## Hi, I'm Lyn👋

I am an aspriring software engineer located in Glasgow, who is currently working fulltime in finance.

In 2025, I was part of the *Code First Girls* coding bootcamp, where I completed the *CFGDegree* in Software engineering. I have also started working through the *CS50x* course from Harvard to strengthen my computer science knowledge.

During my spare time I have also been working on a couple of personal projects:
+ [chapters.](https://github.com/LynSab/Bookclub-app) - a book club management app
+ [Tiny Bard](https://github.com/LynSab/tiny-bard) - an audio atmosphere app for tabletop games

I recently got my hands on an Arduino Starter Kit that I am very much looking forward to getting stuck into.
